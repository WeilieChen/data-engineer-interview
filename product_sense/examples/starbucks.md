    Check if we added any new products.
    Check if decline in sales order by different segments, ex: new customers, old customers

Customers
    How many are new customers or returning. It matters because it helps us understand if we retaining customers.
    How often are they coming in, and time of day they are coming to help staffing.

Expenses
    Supplies and operating costs.
    Check if our reasonable window prices are reasonable.
    How many employees do we need and when we need them.

Weekly or monthly makes sense, but if there is holiday, then I might check by daily.
