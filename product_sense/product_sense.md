## Types
* Measuring Success
* Diagnose a problem
* Launch decision

## Focus metrics
* Users: how many users does the app/platform ahve in a day? a week?
* Usage: how often are they clicking on certain features?
* Conversion: what percent of users/clicks pay for something?

## Measuring Success
Your goal is to recommend measuring a specific metric.
Suggestting that if a metric increased/decrease by x% over specific time frame, then the product can be considerd a success.

**Understand product and its positioning**
* What does product do? How is it used? Who uses it?
* Is it launch vs existing product?
* Are there competitors?
* What are the industry trends?

**Determine strategic goal**
* Growth in users
* Engagement and retention
* Monetization

**Metric Categories**
* Number of active users (daily/weekly/monthly)
    * If this is a new product, you can use a competing product's number of active users as a benchmark.
    * If this is an existing product, you can measure if the number of active users increases or decreases.
* Number of interactions (swipes, post, likes)
    * If this is a new feature, you can benchmark the number of interactions against existing features.
    * If this is an enhancement to an existing feature, you can measure if the number of interactions increases or decreases.
* Conversion rate (ad clicks, confirmed purchases, premium subscriptions)
    * If this is this is a new product/feature you can benchmark the conversation rate against other products
    * If this is an enhancement to an existing product/feature, you can measure if the conversation rate increases or decreases

**Summarize**
* Suggest if metric increased/decreased by x% over a specific time frame, then product is a success.
* Mention method of A/B testing, regression testing, setting a guardrail metric

## Daignosing a Problem
Goal to give reasonable root causes and fixes for some drop/increase of a specific metric.

**Clarify how x% drop is being measured**
* Compared to the previous day? previous month?
* Is the drop platform wide? or specific feature?
* Is it sudden or trend over time?

**Segment to determine the problem area**
* Is the problem happening in one specfic geographic area? languages? operating platform (iOS, Android, Web)?
* Is this happening industry wide? Are compeitors experiencing as well?

**Establish a few possible theories**
* Internal: data source? data collection? bug?
* External: seasonality? industry trend? compeitors? special event?
* Have we made any changes to our product line?
* Have other related products experienced the same change?
* It could be some technical issue at some step or with some platform
* There could be a regional service outage
* We could be receiving bad data due to msising or duplicated data

**Come up with metrics to investiage**
* Number of clicks among products/demographics/regions
* Number of error log messages
* Time taken in between clicks/steps

Progressive vs Sudden?
Regional vs Global?
Specific platform?
Decline in main platform, industry trend or other features?
User segment in decline?

## Launch Decision
Goal is to define metrics to measure if a new product/change to an existing product is successfull or not.
Should we launch x this to product?

Confirm understanding
    Background
    Goal: Growth in users, Engagement and retention, Monetization

Examine impact/areas of improvement based on goal
    User demographic, specific step, conversion

Design an experiement focused on a specific group
    Focus on the group with the most users, impact or revenue
    Identity some metrics to measure within this group
    Suggest doing A/B testing, regression testing, and setting some guardrail metric

Summarize
    Suggest that if youre metric increase/decreased by x% over a specific time frame, then you would recommend launching
    Consider short and long term results
    Mention the possibility of launching some but not all new features or launching over a staggerd timeline
